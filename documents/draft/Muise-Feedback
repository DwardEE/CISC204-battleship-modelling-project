    - for ships must be confined within the grid (all possible starting points for i and j
    - winning configuration - count number of hits instead of sinking ship for game over
    - interesting if change aim of encoding given configuration what are the ways that the ships could be placed? (model corresponding to a ship placement pattern of opponent given the hit pattern seen already)
    - make sure we have good diagnostic output of whatâ€™s going on - print out battleship board to show what the SAT model is telling us and what it looks like (ie. need visual representation)
