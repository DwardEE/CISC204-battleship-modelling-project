# Modelling Project Draft Submission

As an ungraded draft submission, you are expected to submit a draft of your project part-way through the course. This is essential for (1) other students to provide feedback on your project; and (2) for the teaching staff to offer guidance so that the project is successful.

While a grade will not be assigned, failing to submit this draft may result in poor performance in your final grade, as you will miss out on the critical feedback from both your peers and teaching staff.

## Due Date

November 2nd, 2020

## Expected Items

* *this repository*: We will download the most recent version of your project (including this folder) on the due date.

* `proofs.jp`: The sequents listed that we intend to use describe the ship's location on the board. We want to be able to show that for each ship the corresponding locations are true. For example, if s1 refers to a carrier ship that has size of 5 spaces, we want to check that the locations of the s1 are all true (where p1-p5 are an (x,y) coordinate of each space). 

* `modelling_report.docx` or `modelling_report.pptx` or (`report.txt` and `report.pdf`): Include either the Word/PowerPoint document for your documentation draft, or a link to the OverLeaf project inside of `report.txt` if that is what you chose to use for (D5). If you are using OverLeaf, include a compiled version here as `report.pdf`.

* `feedback`: The areas that we would like feedback on in particular are:
- what is your opinion on Var usage for propositions, given the commented and uncommented drafts
- thoughts on constraints and complexity â€“ possible to loop through constraints?
- in terms of quantifiers, is the extensions clear?
